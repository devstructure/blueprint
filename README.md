# `blueprint` reverse engineers servers for you:

* See what's been installed.
* Standardize development environments.
* Share stacks with your team.
* Generate configurations for Puppet or Chef.
* Audit your infrastructure.

`blueprint` is DevStructure's workhorse tool that looks inside popular package managers, finds changes you made to configuration files, and archives software you built from source to generate Puppet, Chef, or shell code.  Everything blueprint sees is stored in Git to be diffed and pushed.  It runs on Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and newer.

## Try it now!

Run this command on your server and follow the instructions to create your account.  (Remember, you must use Ubuntu 10.04 or newer.)
